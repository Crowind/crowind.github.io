About me!
---------

Hi! I'm Crowind and I live in Pisa, Italy.
After getting my computer science degree i decided to focus on videogame development and I joined the [TheSign Comics and Arts Academy](https://thesign.academy/), where I'm currently enrolled.

My favourite fields are Shaders and Code Architecture.

I have always been versatile: I have basic skills in 2D art, animation, design and game design! That's probably the reason I think the most important part of a project is a shared vision.
