 Hi! My name is Giuseppe *Crowind* De Frenza and I live in Pisa, Italy.
 After getting my computer science degree I decided to focus on videogame development. I joined the TheSign Comics and Arts Academy in 2018, from where I graduated in september 2021 with full marks.

 My favourite fields are Shaders and Code Architecture, but during my career I have been able to learn a lot in multiple fields, like Artificial Intelligence, Procedural Animations, Procedural Generation, and Tool Programming.

 I have always tried to be versatile: I extend tools and libraries when needed and I do extensive researches prior to implementing new algorithms or structures. I also have basic skills in 2D art and game design!
 
 Strategic tabletop games lover, I do also enjoy hiking and playing fighting games. I have played guitar for years in a video-game sountrack cover band and I have played important roles in the organization of more than 100 Super Smash Bros. tournaments in Tuscany.
